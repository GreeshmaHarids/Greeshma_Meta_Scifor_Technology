**Text Preprocessing**

Text preprocessing is crucial for understanding customer feedback and competitor reviews, using machine learning (ML) to make text data interpretable for computers. Key statistical methods include:

1.	Word Frequency Analysis: Identifies commonly used words, aiding in sentiment analysis and highlighting success areas.
2.	Collocation: Finds co-occurring words, especially in bigrams and trigrams.
3.	Concordance: Helps clarify ambiguous language.
4.	TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): Highlights word importance within a document relative to its presence across other documents.
5.	Text Summarization: Condenses complex language into simple themes using techniques like topic modelling.
6.	Text Classification: Organizes vast, unstructured text data.
7.	Keyword Extraction: Automatically identifies essential information from text using AI.
8.	Lemmatization and Stemming: Reduces words to their base forms to ensure consistent analysis.
   
These techniques, grounded in mathematics and statistics, transform raw text into valuable insights for businesses.

**NLTK Documentation**

NLTK, or the Natural Language Toolkit, is a powerful Python library designed for building programs to process and analyse human language data. It provides:

•	Text processing modules for tasks like classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning

•	Wrappers for NLP libraries and support for computational linguistics concepts

Supported on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux, NLTK is open source, free, and community-driven, making it suitable for linguists, engineers, students, researchers, and educators.

Installation:
1.	Install NLTK:
   
	*pip install nltk*
3.	Download NLTK Data (e.g., corpora, resources):
   
	*import nltk*

	*nltk.download('all')*

Core Features:
1.	Tokenization: Breaking text into words or sentences.
   
	*from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize*

	*sentence = "NLTK makes text processing simple."*

	*tokens = word_tokenize(sentence)*
3.	Tagging: Labeling words with part-of-speech tags.
   
	*from nltk import pos_tag*

	*tagged = pos_tag(tokens)*
5.	Identify named entities:
   
	*from nltk import ne_chunk*

	*entities = ne_chunk(tagged)*
7.	Displaying sentence structure as parse trees.
   
	*from nltk.corpus import treebank
	t = treebank.parsed_sents('wsj_0001.mrg')[0]*

  *t.draw()*

Advanced Usage Examples:

•	Text Classification

•	Keyword Extraction

•	Text Summarization

•	Topic Modeling

**Introduction to NLP and spaCy**

**NLP**

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of AI focused on enabling computers to understand and analyse human language. It powers applications like summarization, entity recognition, and sentiment analysis, transforming unstructured text into valuable insights. Transformer models, like Google’s BERT and OpenAI’s GPT, represent the latest advancements, and spaCy supports these models from version 3.0 onward.

**spaCy**
spaCy is an efficient, open-source NLP library in Python, built for fast processing of language data with extensive features like tokenization, parsing, and semantic analysis, making it ideal for NLP tasks.
Installation Guide
To install spaCy and set up a language model for English, follow these steps:
1.	Create a Virtual Environment:
   
  *python -m venv venv*
  
  *# Activate it*
3.	Install spaCy:

  *(venv) python -m pip install spacy*
4.	Download the English Model:

  *(venv) python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm*
5.	Verify:

  *import spacy*
  
   *nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")*
